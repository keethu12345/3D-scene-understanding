# NeRF-Transformer 3D Scene Understanding

## Project Overview
This project explores the integration of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) and Transformers to advance 3D scene understanding. The goal is to enhance the spatial representation and coherence of 3D reconstructions by leveraging the strengths of both NeRFs and Transformers.

## Modules
1. Introduction and Setup
2. NeRF Implementation
3. Transformer Integration
4. Hybrid Pipeline Design
5. Benchmarking and Evaluation
6. Applications and Use Cases
7. Documentation and Final Report

## Objectives
- Implement NeRF for 3D scene reconstruction.
- Integrate Transformers to improve spatial representation.
- Design and evaluate a hybrid NeRF-Transformer pipeline.
- Benchmark performance on synthetic and real-world datasets.
- Explore applications in virtual reality, autonomous systems, and augmented reality.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Google Colab account
